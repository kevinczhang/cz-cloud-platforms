# Data analytics

## Big Query

BigQuery is Google's fully managed, petabyte scale, low cost analytics data warehouse. BigQuery is NoOps—there is no infrastructure to manage and you don't need a database administrator—so you can focus on analyzing data to find meaningful insights, use familiar SQL, and take advantage of our pay-as-you-go model. With BigQuery, you can:

* Create custom schemas that organize your data into datasets and tables.
* Load data from a variety of sources, including streaming data.
* Use SQL-like commands to query massive datasets very quickly. BigQuery is designed and optimized for speed.
* Use the web UI, command-line interface, or API.
* Load, query, export, and copy data by using jobs.
* Manage data and protect it by using permissions.

## Cloud Dataflow

[Cloud Dataflow](https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/what-is-google-cloud-dataflow) provides a managed service and set of SDKs that you can use to perform batch and streaming data processing tasks. Dataflow works well for high-volume computation, especially when the processing tasks can clearly and easily be divided into parallel workloads. Dataflow is also great for extract-transform-load \(ETL\) tasks, which are useful for moving data between different storage media, transforming data into a more desirable format, or loading data onto a new storage system.

[Cloud Dataflow](https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/) is a fully managed service for transforming and enriching data in stream \(real time\) and batch \(historical\) modes with equal reliability and expressiveness. Cloud Dataflow's serverless approach frees you from operational tasks like capacity planning, resource management, and performance optimization, while you only pay for what you use. Plus, Cloud Dataflow not only works with Google's [ingestion](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/), [data warehousing](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/), and [machine learning](https://cloud.google.com/ml-engine/) products, but also third-party tools like Apache Spark and Apache Beam.

## Cloud Dataproc

Managed Apache Spark and Apache Hadoop

[Cloud Dataproc](https://cloud.google.com/dataproc/) is a fast, easy-to-use, fully managed cloud service for running Apache Spark and Apache Hadoop clusters in a simpler, more cost-efficient way. Operations that used to take hours or days take seconds or minutes instead — and you pay only for the resources you use with per-second billing. Cloud Dataproc integrates with storage, compute, and monitoring services across Google Cloud products, giving you a powerful and complete data processing platform.

## Cloud Pub/Sub

[Cloud Pub/Sub](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/) is an asynchronous messaging service. Your application can send messages, as JSON data structures, to a publishing unit called a _topic_. Because Cloud Pub/Sub topics are a global resource, other applications in projects that you own can subscribe to the topic to receive the messages in HTTP request or response bodies. To familiarize yourself with Cloud Pub/Sub, see the [Cloud Pub/Sub quickstart](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/quickstart-console).

Cloud Pub/Sub's usefulness isn't confined to big data. You can use Cloud Pub/Sub in many circumstances where you need an asynchronous messaging service. For an example that uses Cloud Pub/Sub to coordinate App Engine and Compute Engine, see [Reliable Task Scheduling on Compute Engine](https://cloud.google.com/solutions/reliable-task-scheduling-compute-engine).

## Cloud Data Fusion

Fully managed, code-free data integration service

[Cloud Data Fusion](https://cloud.google.com/data-fusion/) is a fully managed, cloud-native data integration service that helps users efficiently build and manage ETL/ELT data pipelines. With a graphical interface and a broad open-source library of preconfigured connectors and transformations, Data Fusion shifts an organization's focus away from code and integration to insights and action.

## Cloud Composer

Workflow orchestration

[Cloud Composer](https://cloud.google.com/composer/) is a fully managed workflow orchestration service that empowers you to author, schedule, and monitor pipelines that span across clouds and on-premises data centers. Built on the popular Apache Airflow open-source project and operated using the Python programming language, Cloud Composer is free from lock-in and easy to use. Plus, with end-to-end integration for GCP workloads, you can orchestrate a full pipeline with all of Google Cloud's big data products.

## Cloud Data Transfer

Data transfer services

[Cloud Data Transfer](https://cloud.google.com/products/data-transfer/) offers solutions that meet your unique data transfer needs and move data to [Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage/), [BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/), or [Cloud Dataproc](https://cloud.google.com/dataproc/) quickly and securely. Whether you have 50 gigabytes or 50 petabytes of data, one-time or recurring transfers, or a T1 line or a 10 Gbps network connection, our data transfer services are here to meet your unique needs.

## Cloud Bigtable

Fully managed NoSQL database service

[Cloud Bigtable](https://cloud.google.com/bigtable/) provides a massively scalable NoSQL database suitable for low-latency and high-throughput workloads. It integrates easily with popular big-data tools like Hadoop and Spark, and it supports the open-source, industry-standard HBase API. Cloud Bigtable is a great choice for both operational and analytical applications, including IoT, user analytics, and financial data analysis.

## Cloud Storage

Object storage for big data

[Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage/) is a unified object storage solution that allows worldwide storage and retrieval of any amount of data at any time. You can use Cloud Storage for a range of scenarios, including serving website content, storing data for archival and disaster recovery, or distributing large data objects to users via direct download.
