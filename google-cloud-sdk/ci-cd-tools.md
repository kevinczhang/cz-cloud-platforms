# CI/CD Tools

## [Cloud Build](https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build)

Cloud Build is a service that executes your builds on Google Cloud Platform infrastructure. Cloud Build can import source code from Google Cloud Storage, Cloud Source Repositories, GitHub, or Bitbucket, execute a build to your specifications, and produce artifacts such as Docker containers or Java archives.

## [Container Registry](https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/)

Container Registry is a single place for your team to manage Docker images, perform vulnerability analysis, and decide who can access what with fine-grained access control. Existing CI/CD integrations let you set up fully automated Docker pipelines to get fast feedback.

## [Cloud Source Repositories](https://cloud.google.com/source-repositories/)

Cloud Source Repositories are private Git repositories hosted on Google Cloud Platform that feature fast, indexed code search across all your repositories.
