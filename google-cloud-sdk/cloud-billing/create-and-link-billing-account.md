# Create and Link Billing Account

## Create a new billing account

To create a new billing account:

1. Go to the [Google Cloud Platform Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) and sign in or, if you don't already have an account, sign up.
2. Open the console left side menu and select **Billing**.
3. Click the **New billing account** button. \(Note that if this is not your first billing account, first you need to open the billing account list by clicking the name of your existing billing account near the top of the page, and then clicking **Manage billing accounts**.\)
4. Enter the name of the billing account and enter your billing information. The options you see depend on the country of your billing address. Note that for United States accounts, you cannot change tax status after the account is created.
5. Click **Submit and enable billing**.

By default, the person who creates the billing account is a billing administrator for the account.

## Change the billing account for a project

To change the billing account for an existing project, **you must be an owner on the project and a billing administrator on the destination billing account**. For information about billing administrators and billing permissions, see [Overview of Access Control](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/billing-access).

To change the billing account:

1. Go to the [Google Cloud Platform Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2. Open the console left side menu and select **Billing**.
3. If you have more than one billing account, you'll be prompted to select **Go to linked billing account** to manage the current project's billing.
4. Under **Projects linked to this billing account**, locate the name of the project that you want to change billing for, and then click the menu next to it.
5. Select **Change billing account**, then choose the desired destination billing account.
6. Click **Set account**.
