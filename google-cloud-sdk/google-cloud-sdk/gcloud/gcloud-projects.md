# gcloud projects

The gcloud projects group lets you create and manage IAM policies for projects on the Google Cloud Platform. Resources are organized hierarchically and assigned to a particular project. A Project resource is required to use Google Cloud Platform, and forms the basis for creating, enabling and using all Cloud Platform services, managing APIs, enabling billing, adding and removing collaborators, and managing permissions.
