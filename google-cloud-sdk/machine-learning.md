## ML APIs

GCP offers a variety of APIs that enable you to take advantage of Google's ML without creating and training your own models.

* [Google Cloud Video Intelligence API](https://cloud.google.com/video-intelligence/docs/) lets you use video analysis technology that provides label detection, explicit content detection, shot-change detection, and regionalization features.
* [Google Cloud Speech API](https://cloud.google.com/speech/docs/) lets you convert audio to text, recognizing over 110 languages and variants, to support your global user base. You can transcribe the text of users dictating to an applicationâ€™s microphone, enable command-and-control through voice, or transcribe audio files, among other use cases.
* [Google Cloud Vision API](https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs) lets you easily integrate vision detection features, including image labeling, face and landmark detection, optical character recognition \(OCR\), and tagging of explicit content.
* [Google Natural Language API](https://cloud.google.com/natural-language/docs) lets you add sentiment analysis, entity analysis, entity-sentiment analysis, content classification, and syntax analysis.
* [Google Cloud Translation API](https://cloud.google.com/translate/docs) lets you quickly translate source text into any of over a hundred supported languages. Language detection helps out in cases where the source language is not known.
* [Dialogflow Enterprise Edition](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow-enterprise/docs) lets you build conversational interfaces for websites, mobile applications, popular messaging platforms, and IoT devices. You can use it to build interfaces, such as chatbots, that are capable of natural and rich interactions with humans.

## Cloud ML Engine

[Cloud Machine Learning Engine](https://cloud.google.com/ml-engine/docs/technical-overview) combines the managed infrastructure of GCP with the power and flexibility of TensorFlow. You can use it to train your machine learning models at scale, and to host trained models to make predictions about new data in the cloud.

Cloud ML Engine enables you to train machine learning models by running TensorFlow training applications on GCP, and hosts those trained models for you, so you can use them to get predictions about new data. Cloud ML Engine manages the computing resources that your training job needs to run, so you can focus more on your model than on hardware configuration or resource management.
