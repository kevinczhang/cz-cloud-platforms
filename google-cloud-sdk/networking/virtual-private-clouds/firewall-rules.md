# Firewall Rules

Each VPC network implements a distributed virtual firewall that you can configure. Firewall rules allow you to control which packets are allowed to travel to which destinations. Every VPC network has two [implied firewall rules](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/firewalls#default_firewall_rules) that block all incoming connections and allow all outgoing connections.
