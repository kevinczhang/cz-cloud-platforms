# Storage

GCP provides a variety of storage services, including:

* A SQL database in [Cloud SQL](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/), which provides either MySQL or PostgreSQL databases.
* A fully managed, mission-critical, relational database service in [Cloud Spanner](https://cloud.google.com/spanner/docs/) that offers transactional consistency at global scale, schemas, SQL querying, and automatic, synchronous replication for high availability.
* Two options for NoSQL data storage: [Cloud Datastore](https://cloud.google.com/datastore/docs/concepts/overview) and [Cloud Bigtable](https://cloud.google.com/bigtable/docs/).
* Consistent, scalable, large-capacity data storage in [Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/overview). Cloud Storage comes in several flavors:
  * Multi-Regional provides maximum availability and geo-redundancy.
  * Regional provides high availability and a localized storage location.
  * Nearline provides low-cost archival storage ideal for data accessed less than once a month.
  * Coldline provides the lowest-cost archival storage for backup and disaster recovery.
* [Persistent disks on Compute Engine](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/#overview), for use as primary storage for your instances. Compute Engine offers both hard-disk-based persistent disks, called _standard persistent disks_, and solid-state persistent disks \(SSD\).
