# Big Query

BigQuery is Google's fully managed, petabyte scale, low cost analytics data warehouse. BigQuery is NoOps—there is no infrastructure to manage and you don't need a database administrator—so you can focus on analyzing data to find meaningful insights, use familiar SQL, and take advantage of our pay-as-you-go model.

#### Good for:

* OLAP workloads up to petabyte scale
* Big data exploration and processing
* Reporting via business intelligence \(BI\) tools

#### Common workloads:

* Analytical reporting on large data
* Data science and advanced analyses
* Big data processing using SQL

#### Calculating cost:

* UI: Query validator
* CLI: --dry-run
* REST: dryRun property to true
